        <li>First gather your ingredients.</li>

        <li>Once you're done, place all the tortillas in a warm pan to keep them warm until you're ready to use them.</li>
        <li>Place your enchilada sauce in a bowl so that you can dip each tortilla easily.</li>
        <li>Now begin the process of dipping each tortilla one by one into the sauce</li>
        <li>Place your finished dipped tortilla in a 9- by 13- inch baking dish and begin placing your filler and meat of your choice down the middle of the tortilla.</li>
        <li>Fold each tortilla now.</li>
        <li>Turn the enchilada over, seam side down, so the tortilla stays closed, and place it in the baking dish.</li>
        <li>Repeat this process until you've done this to all the tortillas.</li>
        <li>Once coocked gently drench the tortillas with any remaining sauce.</li>
        <li>Top it off with the remaining cheese and lettuce.</li>
